<h1 class = "heading">Hello dear readers!</h1>
<h3 class = "heading">I hope you'll enjoy reading my html exercises.</h3>
<p> This is a paragraph of text about nothing </p>
<b>And this text is using the bold tag.</b>
<i>While this text is written using italic.</i>
<ul id = "niceList">
    <li>First item</li>
    <li>Second item</li>
    <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
<p>If those were <strong>css</strong> exercises I would <em>>change</em> this list's style but it's just html 
based exercise so let's leave it at that.</p>
